	Aim of the event
	</h2>

	To travel the full length of the A470 without deviation from Cardiff to Llandudno.
	<br />
	To ensure that the route is adhered to, there will be a number of questions to be answered along the way.
	<br />

	As all participants will start at 11:00, the winner of the event will be the first team to arrive at the end point having answered all questions correctly, and having adhered fully to the highway code.  Due to logistical constraints, there may be no marshals present at the end, therefore proof of arivial time has to be obtained by the following method.
	<br />
	On entering Llandudno, the majority of the high street banks are located along Mostyn Street.  Each team will need to obtain a receipt from one of the banks ATM's showing branch, date and time.
	<br />
	Once the receipt has been obtained, all entrants are to proceed to the Fat Cat Cafe Bar on Upper Mostyn Street
